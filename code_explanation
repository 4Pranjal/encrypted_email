This code demonstrates how to send and receive encrypted emails using the `rsa` library for encryption and the `smtplib` library for sending emails via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The goal is to ensure that the email content remains confidential between the sender and the recipient.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries - `rsa` for encryption, `smtplib` for email sending, `MIMEText` for email content, and `base64` for encoding and decoding.

2. **Generate RSA Key Pair**: A public-private key pair is generated using the `rsa.newkeys()` function. In this example, a 512-bit key length is used (64 bytes), which creates a public key and a private key.

3. **Send Encrypted Email Function**: The `send_email` function is defined to send encrypted emails. The function takes the subject, message, sender's email address, recipient's email address, sender's password, and recipient's public key as input.

   - The message is encrypted using the recipient's public key using the `rsa.encrypt()` function.
   - The encrypted message is converted to a string using `base64` encoding.
   - An email message is created using `MIMEText`, with the encrypted message as the content.
   - The email is sent using an SMTP server, Gmail's in this case, with appropriate credentials and encryption (TLS) applied.

4. **Decrypt Email Function**: The `decrypt_email` function is defined to decrypt the received email content. It takes the encrypted message string and the recipient's private key as input.

   - The encrypted message string is decoded from `base64` encoding.
   - The message is decrypted using the recipient's private key with `rsa.decrypt()`.
   - The decrypted message is returned as a string.

5. **Example Usage**: An example usage is provided using the generated key pair.

   - The sender's public key is used as the recipient's public key (Note: In practice, public keys are securely exchanged beforehand).
   - The `send_email` function is called to send an email with the subject, body, sender's email address, recipient's email address, sender's password, and recipient's public key.

6. **Recipient's Side**: On the recipient's side, the encrypted message string is assumed to be received.

   - The encrypted message string is provided as input to the `decrypt_email` function, along with the recipient's private key.
   - The decrypted message is printed.

This code demonstrates a basic example of encrypting and decrypting email messages using RSA encryption. However, please note that in real-world scenarios, a more secure exchange of public keys and a robust approach to key management are necessary to ensure the security of the communication.
